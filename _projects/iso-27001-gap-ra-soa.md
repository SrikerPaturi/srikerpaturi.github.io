## Context
A product startup aiming for enterprise sales needs ISO 27001 alignment in 12 weeks.

## Scope
- Org scope and ISMS boundaries  
- Assets, processes, and stakeholders

## What I Did
1. **Gap Assessment** against Annex A controls (mapped to 27002).  
2. **Risk Assessment** — likelihood × impact, business context aligned.  
3. **Statement of Applicability (SoA)** — included/excluded controls with justification.  
4. **Risk Treatment Plan** — owners, timelines, acceptance criteria.  
5. **Policy Pack** — lightweight, versioned docs.

## Outcomes
- Prioritized remediation backlog and a publish-ready SoA.  
- Audit-ready evidence list and schedule.

## Artifacts
- [Gap Assessment (CSV)](/assets/resources/iso-gap-assessment.csv)  
- [Risk Register (CSV)](/assets/resources/iso-risk-register.csv)  
- [Statement of Applicability (PDF)](/assets/resources/iso-soa-sample.pdf)

> **How to Use:** Fork the CSVs, adjust columns (owner, due, status), and ship weekly.
