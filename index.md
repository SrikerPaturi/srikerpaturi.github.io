## Warrior Mindset × Cybersecurity

I operate with **discipline and clarity** — the same way I coach swimmers to cut noise and move with purpose.  
In GRC and security analysis, that means: **tight scopes, clean documentation, measurable risk reduction**, and artifacts anyone can use.

- **GRC / ISO 27001** — Gap assessments, SoA, policies, risk treatment, audit readiness.  
- **Security Analyst** — SIEM monitoring, vuln scans, hardening baselines, incident workflow.  
- **Coach** — Build habits, sharpen fundamentals, and deliver under pressure.

> *Tagline:* **Discipline. Security. Strength.**

### Highlights

- ISO 27001 Lead Implementer (in progress/complete).  
- **Sentriforge Security** — mock ISMS + assessments (public artifacts).  
- Internship research on India's cybersecurity market (sanitized excerpts).
