I'm **Sriker Paturi** — a cybersecurity & GRC analyst and **swim coach**. I build **secure processes** and **strong athletes**.

### Mission
Reduce risk and raise standards without slowing the mission. Clear language, practical artifacts, measurable outcomes.

### Brand Principles
- **Discipline > Motivation** — systems and cadence beat willpower.  
- **Clarity > Complexity** — simple artifacts that teams actually use.  
- **Pressure-tested** — labs, checklists, and playbooks built from reps.

### Certifications & Focus
- ISO/IEC 27001 (Lead Implementer)  
- Roadmap: Security+, CISA  
- GRC: 27001/27002/27005, SoA, risk treatment, policy packs  
- Analyst: SIEM (ELK/Wazuh), vuln scanning, hardening baselines, IR workflow

### Coaching (Swim)
- Technique-first: balance, bodyline, streamlined breathing.  
- Strength & conditioning aligned with recovery.  
- Goal: **calm, efficient, repeatable performance**.

### Timeline (Next 3–5 Years)
- 2025–2026: Move to Colorado, EMT-B, security analyst roles  
- 2027–2028: Paramedic school + National Guard track (18D)  
- Beyond: Blend operational medicine with cyber defense
